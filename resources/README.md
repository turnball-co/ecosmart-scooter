## Resources

The files found under this folder are resources that are intendeds for FDM 3D printing.   Specifically these files are produced using PETG predominently for its ruggedness and the intended outdoor and temperature sensitive environments it is anticipated these prints and the underlying scooter will find itself.  THese prints are also expected to be capable of withstanding some modest uses such as standing upon the part as its being used as the base-board (i.e. replacement of the wooden 'Razor' board as shown on the main page's graphic).

Further detail pertaining to these printed models and their uses are expected to follow.  Initial designs of this base-plate were done to house the upgrade from a 36V battery set (3 lead acid batteries) into a single 48V Lithium Ion batterypack.  This upgrade found it necessary to upgrade the motor immediately following the battery upgrade which saw us also taking the opportunity to go from a 500 watt motor to a 2000 watt motor, along with the expected hardware and gear surrounding such an upgrade such as a key-based system so that we could steer clear of the simple "On/Off" switch and the rather "dumb" power connection.
