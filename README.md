## Ecosmart Razer Metro Scooter
![Ride](scooter.png "My Scooter")

This repository is to capture the improvements and upgrades made to the Ecosmart Razor Metro scooter pictured above.  Having received this machine several years after it was purchased and then imemdiately stored, it was largely stock when it arrived in my care.

Within weeks, the Lead Acid Batteries went bad -- a known issue with this particular hardware.  A new 48v Lithium ION battery pack of 20,000mah was obtained via Alibaba, a tidy $40 off the same hardware listed with Amazon.  It was shipped from a US-based battery provider leading me to wonder if this is just another place where Amazon is charging American consumers increased prices with little to no one seeming to care stateside.

Following the upgrade to the battery, the motor was fried due to my riding the scooter up a somewhat challenging hill.  Within a week, magic smoke was pillowing from the 500w stock motor leading this upgrade adventure to its next target :: the Motor!

A 2000w 48V motor was acquired, a notable improvement over the stock rated motor and speed module -- acquired as part of a kit along with a new throttle that has a more granular battery charge indicator to advance us beyond the "Full / Low" indications that are standard on this scooter model.  It also comes along with a key security device which should assist with some of the issues encountered when the entire bike was enabled with a simply flip of the On/Off switch.  

## Future Expansions

New battery cover has been designed to enable us to add a second 48v 20ah LION battery, with the two 48v batteries setting on their side, and the 2000w module/controller setting atop the dual battery pack postured alongside the side.  This means that the same battery cover design + 55mm of space were added to the top of the design, however between the maximum top speed of 50 mph, the added features of the speedometer, turn signals, lighting all in accordance with making the machine a fully street legal piece of equipment -- the scooter is consistent with the ~ 49/50cc gas powered mopeds all while even featuring the enhancements that you'd desire and expect out of a fully licensed and legal motorcycle.  Please be sure to check your local laws and regulations to ensure compliance when making such modifications.

The new battery cover design is being 3D printed in PETG to ensure durability and weather resistance.  The design files will be made available in this repository once finalized.

Upgrades to the lighting system are also being considered, with the addition of LED head and tail lights to improve visibility and safety during night rides.  These upgrades are also required as per local laws and regulations as street riding is disallowed without visibility lighting to ensure safety between riders and other occupants of the roads.  The integration of turn signals is also planned to enhance communication with other road users.

I've also designed a dashboard panel to house the speedometer and other controls, which will be 3D printed and installed on the scooter.  This panel will provide easy access to essential information while riding, including the housing of the headlamp,turn signal controls, and a liquid crystal display speedometer for real-time speed monitoring and other information.  I am using a Raspberry Pi PICO powered by one of numerous non-used VCC links from the scooter's speed controller unit with the PICO being housed in the barry box, alongside the battery, controller and other electronics.  The PICO will interface with the speedometer display to provide real-time speed monitoring and other information and function the turn signals.

Further design work has been underway and printed in prototype form for the sideview mirrors, which will be mounted on the handlebars to enhance rear visibility and safety.  These mirrors are being designed to be adjustable and durable, ensuring they can withstand the rigors of daily use.

Stay tuned for further updates as we continue to enhance and optimize the Ecosmart Razor Metro scooter!

## Installation Instructions

Using the following steps, you can upgrade your Ecosmart Razor Metro scooter with the new battery and motor kits.  I intend to update this section with images and diagrams as time permits and as the project scope expands. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to reach out.  If you'd like to contribute images or diagrams, please submit a pull request and I'll be happy to include them.

### Battery Upgrade

1. Remove the existing battery cover by unscrewing the bolts and carefully lifting it off.
2. Disconnect the old battery and remove it from the scooter.
3. Install the new 48V Lithium ION battery pack, ensuring all connections are secure
4. Replace the battery cover with the new design, securing it with bolts.
5. Test the scooter to ensure all systems are functioning correctly with the new battery.

### Motor Upgrade

1. For motor upgrade, disconnect the old motor and throttle
2. Then install the new 2000W motor and throttle kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Test the scooter again to ensure the new motor and throttle are functioning properly.

## Safety Precautions

- Always wear appropriate safety gear, including a helmet, gloves, and protective clothing.
- Ensure the scooter is turned off and disconnected from any power source before beginning any upgrades.
- Follow all manufacturer instructions for the new battery and motor installation.
- If unsure about any step of the installation process, seek assistance from a professional technician.
